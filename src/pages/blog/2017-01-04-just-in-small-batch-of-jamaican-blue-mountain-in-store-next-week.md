# Learn More About Happiness

## Roots of Happiness

According to happiness researchers, it can be described as “the experience of joy, contentment, or positive wellbeing, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.” Happiness is both how you feel on an emotional level, and how you feel about your life in general. It comes from a combination of factors: your body, genetics, and environment, and also how you relate to yourself, how you relate to others, how you relate to your work, how you relate to something larger than yourself, and your sense of meaning and purpose. Because of genetic factors, some people tend to experience more positive emotions than other people, but studies show that at least 40-50% of our happiness is under our control, which is a lot! This means that there is much you can do to experience more happiness, wellbeing, and flourishing in your life.

Many people think that happiness comes from feeling good all the time, but research shows that happiness comes more from a combination of factors and isn’t just about having positive emotions, although those are a part of what makes us happy. In fact, it’s normal to experience a wide range of emotions! People who experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions actually tend to be healthier and less depressed.

## Happiness Factors

Research now shows us that many other factors are vital to our happiness. According to vast amounts of research, the quality of your social connections may be the single most important aspect of your overall wellbeing and happiness. Social connections will make you live longer, give you more pleasure, and make you feel more positive about your life.

How you relate to the experiences in your life is also of high importance. This is why states like gratitude, empathy, altruism, and forgiveness can be so helpful to your wellbeing. These states can make you happier, connect you with others, sustain your relationships, and improve your health. This is also why a practice like mindfulness can be so powerful for increasing happiness, as it also has benefits across many of the happiness-factors.

Another important factor is the feeling that your life has meaning and purpose. When you have a sense that your life is worthwhile and that you are connected to yourself, others, and something greater, you are more likely to experience your life as happier and more fulfilling.

The experience of awe has also been shown to be important for wellbeing. Awe is the feeling that happens when you come face-to-face with vastness, when your perspective on the world is expanded. This could come from anything, but some common ways people experience awe are from nature, religious or spiritual experience, art, music, and other people.

Your body also plays a large role in your happiness. Research shows that genetics do play a factor in a person’s basic level of happiness. However, many factors mentioned above are under our control, which means that no matter what your genetic situation is, you can do a lot to improve your level of happiness. Your physical health is also important, which is why it is important to exercise, eat well, and get enough rest.

Finally, it can sometimes be helpful to receive assistance from an expert in one or more of these areas. This could mean receiving therapy, mind-body medicine, medication, herbal medicine, or some other form of help.

The research on happiness is showing us so many ways to have a positive, fulfilling, and meaningful life, and we have outlined some of the most important ones here. We encourage you to explore what it means to flourish as a human being, and to begin finding ways that work for you!
