# Learn More About Friendships

Humans are social animals with an internal drive to seek connection and belonging. We find these qualities through many kinds of interpersonal relationships: the people we meet through work, school, and other social groups. Not finding belonging has been shown to create harm to wellbeing. Loneliness, a mixture of emotions that arise from perceived social isolation, has been associated with a host of ill effects, including depression, poor sleep, “accelerated cognitive decline,” heart problems, and more.

## Personal Growth

Personal growth may be one of the ways to grow self-confidence that can help you cultivate more meaningful connections to others. Finding meaningful work or volunteering, for example, is a great way to connect to your passions and discover what makes you tick. It may seem counter-intuitive, but increasing your own self-awareness actually increases your empathy for others.

Getting in touch with your feelings is key to self-awareness, and practices like journaling and working with a therapist can help you do that. Finding meaningful work and having a sense of purpose also can lead to increased self-esteem. Feeling better about yourself can help you build healthier, more fulfilling relationships.

## Friendships

Friends can help prevent loneliness, boost your sense of self-worth, and help you cope with stress and tough times. Friends very often have common interests, so if you’re looking for friends, try taking a class, volunteering, or joining a meet-up.

## Social Media

Social media -- such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube -- is shifting how humans interact with each other. Of course, more time spent online can mean less time for face-to-face interactions.

The science around social media and relationships is complex. In one study, teens who spend twice as much online as their peers report much higher feelings of perceived social isolation. Yet, according to the Pew Forum, teens report that they feel closer to their friends via social media; for instance, 83% of teens say they are more connected to information about their friends’ lives and 70% feel more connected to their friends’ feelings. And, nearly the same amount say that they have received support during tough times. One case study showed that Facebook can help build a sense of community after a disaster.

Social media, used in moderation, can be a great tool for making connections, but it can’t effectively replace in-person interaction. You must develop trust and empathy to have good relationships. You can show your care through words of affirmation, acts of kindness, and more. Cultivating good communication skills (e.g. active listening and "I" statements) is key to sustaining healthy friendships.
