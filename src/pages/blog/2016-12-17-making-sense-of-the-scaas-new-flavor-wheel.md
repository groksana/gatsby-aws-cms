# Learn More About Parenting

Parenting stress takes a toll on both you and on your child. It can affect your family relationships and even escalate some child behavior problems. The key factor of parenting quality is bond. During very early childhood, strong emotional attachment between parent and infant allows him/her to explore the world confidently. Your child will connect to others based on these relationship patterns. If the attachment is secure, the child recognizes the responsive caregiver as a “safe base” to return for help and protection when it is needed. In the opposite way, if the attachment is weak, the child will feel insecure and anxious to try new things and to build future relationships. Therefore, attachment experience is related to the child’s social functioning, personality traits, and neuro-psychological development. Parent-child bond style is linked with brain structures involved in emotion processing, empathy, and emotion regulation.

## How can you foster a secure bond with your child?

Essential elements such as warmth, eye con!\[](../teen-life/teen-life.jpg)tact, and gentle physical contact (i.e. caressing) can communicate emotions and create intimacy, impacting the child’s entire life. An interesting study on maternal-newborn skin-to-skin contact with 73 premature infants showed increased maternal attachment behavior, reduced maternal anxiety, and enhanced child cognitive development, The children in that study also had better stress management and cognitive control, measured over a decade!

A big parenting challenge can be nurturing a gentle, affectionate bond, under the societal and professional pressure of modern life. Parents can be too busy to enjoy being parents! Household tasks, role overload, negative life events, economic hardships, child misbehavior, adverse childhood experiences, and lack of social support can turn the parenting dream into a stressful experience, especially among mothers.

Parenting is a lifelong endeavor that takes love, patience, and capacity. This includes the capacity to model respect and empathy, to allow your children to take and learn responsibility and for you to set and maintain healthy limits and boundaries.

Yes, it is hard! But it’s possible to create a great parenting style and not get lost in overwhelming demands.
